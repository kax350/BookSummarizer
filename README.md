## Introduction
This project is a tool that summarizes any length of text by recursively calling the ChatGPT-4 API. It aims to provide users with a fast and effective way to grasp the core content of texts, helping to save time reading extensive materials in today's information overload.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Utilizes the ChatGPT-4 API to recursively process and summarize long texts, ensuring users can get an accurate summary.
- **Language Support**: Currently supports input and summarization for both Chinese and English texts.

## Future Development
Our team is actively developing more features, including but not limited to:
- Adding support for additional languages.
- Incorporating text sentiment analysis.
- Providing more detailed summarization options.

Please note that these features are still under development and will be released in the future.
