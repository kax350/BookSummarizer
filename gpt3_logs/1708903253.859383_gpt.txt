of Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi, Pakistan. Karachi was one of the most populous cities in the world. By 1998, over nine million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports in the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the standard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least livable cities in the world. Over 60 percent of Karachis residents lived in squatter settlements and slums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift houses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded materials.

RESPONSE:

Karachi, Pakistan, one of the world's most populous cities, is also one of the least livable due to poor living conditions. Over 60% of its residents live in slums with no waste removal system, electricity grid, or clean water supply, leading to widespread illness and disease. Contaminated water sources cause epidemics, and nearly a third of the children are malnourished. Stephen Luby and his team came to Karachi to address this public health crisis, focusing on the importance of handwashing. Despite residents' awareness of handwashing's importance, it was often done haphazardly or forgotten, indicating a need for better hygiene practices.
