minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution. From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?  WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, youre not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndikes cat, youre just trying things out to see what works. Neurological activity in the brain is high during this period. You are carefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how to act. Youre taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action. Occasionally, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. Youre feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run calms you down. Youre mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing video games relaxes you. Youre exploring, exploring, exploring, and thenBAMa reward. After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog the     events that preceded the reward. Wait a minutethat felt good. What did I do right before that? This is the feedback loop


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the process of habit formation, using Thorndike's studies on cat behavior as a starting point. Thorndike found that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, while those producing unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. This principle applies to human habits, which are behaviors repeated enough times to become automatic. The formation of habits begins with trial and error in new situations, with high neurological activity as the brain analyzes the situation and makes conscious decisions. Once a rewarding solution is found, the brain catalogs the preceding events to repeat the behavior in the future.
