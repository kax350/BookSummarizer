services can do your grocery shopping.  Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website blocker. When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them. Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort in to stop looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open. Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media. When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work. I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. Its easy to write off these minor distractions as just taking a     break, but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug of just one more minute can prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (Im not the only one. The average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?) During the year I was writing

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the benefits and drawbacks of technology and automation in daily life. On one hand, automation can increase productivity by taking over routine tasks, freeing up time and energy for more complex tasks that machines cannot yet perform. This aligns with Alfred North Whitehead's view that civilization advances by increasing the number of operations we can perform without thinking. On the other hand, technology can also encourage unproductive habits, such as binge-watching or excessive social media use, due to its convenience and ability to cater to our smallest whims. The ease of succumbing to these distractions can prevent us from engaging in more challenging, but ultimately more rewarding work.
