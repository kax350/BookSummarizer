Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the quantity group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on. Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the quality group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image. At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the principles of forming good habits and breaking bad ones. To form a good habit, one should make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. This can be achieved by joining a culture where the desired behavior is normal and creating a motivation ritual. To break a bad habit, the principles are inverted: make the habit invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying. This can be done by reducing exposure to cues of bad habits and reframing the mindset to highlight the benefits of avoiding them. The text also shares a story about a photography class where students graded on quantity produced better work than those graded on quality, illustrating the importance of practice and learning from mistakes in skill development.
