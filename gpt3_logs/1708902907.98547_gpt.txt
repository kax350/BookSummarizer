than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly     nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you cant expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.  THE HABITS SCORECARD The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, youll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit. As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, Signal is green. As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When its time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, All clear! Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.* This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is point-only, and within two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent. Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the importance of making unconscious habits conscious to improve them, using the example of the Japanese railway system's "Pointing-and-Calling" safety protocol. This method, which involves pointing at and verbally identifying objects and actions, significantly reduces errors and accidents by raising awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by its successful adoption in the New York City subway system, where it led to a significant decrease in incorrectly berthed subways.
