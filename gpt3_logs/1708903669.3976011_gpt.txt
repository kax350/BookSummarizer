CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over long-term benefits, a trait that can lead to seemingly irrational behavior. This preference for short-term payoffs can be seen in how we respond to potential threats, such as disease or infection, which may not manifest for days, weeks, or even years. This concept is also reflected in the struggle between our present and future selves, with the present self often overpowering the future self's needs and goals due to its immediate presence and control. However, research has shown that individuals who are better at delaying gratification tend to achieve higher SAT scores, indicating a potential benefit to overcoming this inherent bias towards immediate rewards.
