Furthermore, goals create an either-or conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote.

Instead, it suggests focusing on the process or system, which allows for satisfaction and success in various forms and encourages continuous improvement. The text also emphasizes that difficulties in changing habits are not due to personal failings, but rather a flawed system.
