excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didnt even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasnt until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasnt celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.

RESPONSE:

The author discusses the relationship between expectations, failure, and feelings in driving behavior.

They argue that desire and pleasure are key drivers of behavior, with desire initiating action and pleasure sustaining it.
