environmental stimuli that prompt their habitthen returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. Its no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become readdicted once they return home from rehab. The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If youre overweight, a smoker, or an addict, youve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-controlmaybe even that youre a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture. Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals arent all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, disciplined people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and selfcontrol. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. Its easier to practice self-restraint when you dont have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises.

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the influence of environmental stimuli on habits, particularly addiction, challenging the notion that unhealthy behaviors are due to moral weakness or lack of self-control. It cites studies showing that individuals with high self-control are not inherently different from those struggling, but rather they structure their lives to avoid tempting situations, thus requiring less willpower. The text suggests that improving self-control is more about creating a disciplined environment than wishing for more discipline. It also explains that once a habit is formed in the brain, it's ready to be used when the relevant situation arises, emphasizing the role of environmental cues in habit formation and continuation.
