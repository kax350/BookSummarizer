CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The British cycling team achieved significant success from 2007 to 2017, including winning 57% of the road and track cycling medals at the 2008 Olympics and setting world records at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This success was attributed to a strategy of making 1% performance improvements in various areas. Notable British cyclists during this period include Bradley Wiggins, the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France, and Chris Froome, another Tour de France winner. The strategy of small, incremental improvements led to exponential growth in performance, resulting in the team being 37 times better off at the end of the ten-year period.
