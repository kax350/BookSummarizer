Surgeons need to repeat the first incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery.

Its an endless cycle.

This process involves focusing on a small element of success, repeating it until the skill is internalized, and then using this new habit as a foundation for further development. The text also warns against complacency once a skill feels mastered and suggests establishing a system for reflection and review to continuously refine and improve.
