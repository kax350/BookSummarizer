CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

"The Power of Habit" by Duhigg discusses the human brain as a prediction machine, making predictions after perceiving cues. The book explores the concept of habit loops, the difference between professionals and amateurs, and the impact of proximity on behavior. It also delves into strategies for quitting smoking and the importance of reflection and review in habit formation. The author emphasizes the role of reinforcement, repetition, and rewards in mastering a habit, and the need for reframing habits to highlight their benefits. The book also discusses the concept of satisfaction as the completion of the habit loop, the 2nd Law of Behavior Change (Make It Attractive), and the technique of temptation bundling.
