The text introduces a four-step model for human behavior: cue, craving, response, reward. This model helps us understand how to form new habits and provides insights into human behavior. The author explains that a craving is created when we assign meaning to a cue, and this can only occur after we've noticed an opportunity. The text also discusses the concept of happiness, defining it as the absence of desire. When we observe a cue but do not wish to change our state, we are content.
