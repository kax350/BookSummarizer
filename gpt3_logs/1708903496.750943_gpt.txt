where they were correct and where they went wrong.* Improvement is not just about learning habits, its also about finetuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You dont want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective. Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the     previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: 1. What went well this year? 2. What didnt go so well this year? 3. What did I learn? Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.* My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: 1. What are the core values that drive my life and work? 2. How am I living and working with integrity right now? 3. How can I set a higher standard in the future? These two reports dont take very longjust a few hours per year but they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens when I dont pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals. Reflection can


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text emphasizes the importance of reflection and review in personal improvement and habit formation. The author uses two primary modes of reflection: an Annual Review and an Integrity Report. The Annual Review, conducted each December, involves tallying habits and reflecting on the year's progress by answering three questions about what went well, what didn't, and what was learned. The Integrity Report, conducted six months later, focuses on identifying mistakes, revisiting core values, and assessing personal integrity. These reports, though time-limited, are crucial for preventing gradual decline, reminding oneself of desired identity, and determining when to adjust habits or take on new challenges.
