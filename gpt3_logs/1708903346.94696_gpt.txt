carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, George, Im sorry but tens of millions must die. He has to look at someone and realize what death iswhat an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. Its reality brought home.     When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, My God, thats terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the Presidents judgment. He might never push the button. Throughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have covered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying. Fishers proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying. Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly. The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds. We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There cant be a gap between the action and the consequences. As


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the concept of using immediate negative consequences to deter undesirable behavior, a principle that inverts the 4th Law of Behavior Change, which emphasizes the importance of immediate satisfaction in promoting good habits. The author suggests that painful or costly mistakes lead to faster learning and behavior modification. This principle is applied in various contexts, such as a plumber avoiding bad reviews, a restaurant striving to retain customers, or a surgeon avoiding fatal errors. The author proposes that to prevent bad habits or unhealthy behaviors, an immediate cost or punishment should be associated with the action, thereby reducing the likelihood of its repetition.
