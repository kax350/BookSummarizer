RESPONSE:

In 1830, French author Victor Hugo faced a challenging deadline for his new book. Instead of writing, he had spent the year on other activities. To overcome his procrastination, Hugo had all his clothes locked away, leaving him with only a shawl. This forced him to stay indoors and focus on writing, resulting in the early completion of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". This strategy is an example of a commitment device, a choice made in the present to control future actions. It's a method to enforce good habits and restrict bad ones. Other examples of commitment devices include buying food in individual packages to prevent overeating, or voluntarily banning oneself from gambling sites to avoid future gambling.
