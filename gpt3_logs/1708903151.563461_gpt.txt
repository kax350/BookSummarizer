Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.   12 The Law of Least Effort  I  N HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist  and biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: different continents have different shapes. At first glance, this statement seems rather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on human behavior. The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more eastwest in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries. When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. These factors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.    THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR   FIGURE 13: The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere.

RESPONSE:

The 3rd Law of Behavior Change emphasizes the importance of making habits easy to adopt through practice and repetition, rather than focusing on planning. The Law of Least Effort, as discussed in Jared Diamond's book "Guns, Germs, and Steel", highlights how the shape of continents influenced human behavior, particularly the spread of agriculture. The east-west axis of Europe and Asia facilitated the spread of agriculture due to similar climates along the same latitude, unlike the north-south axis of the Americas and Africa. This led to a faster spread of agriculture across Europe and Asia.
