Its real-world origin was as a gambit employed by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at the University of Florida.

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the concept of using physiological responses, such as a fast heartbeat and rapid breathing, as a resource to enhance performance. This idea is supported by studies conducted by Wendy Berry Mendes and Jeremy Jamieson, and personal experiences shared by individuals like Alison Wood Brooks and Ed Latimore. The text also references a story from the book "Art & Fear" by David Bayles and Ted Orland, which emphasizes the universality of the moral, regardless of the art form or medium being discussed.
