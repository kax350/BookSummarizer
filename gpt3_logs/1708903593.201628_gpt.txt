The text also mentions the concept of "habit stacking," a term borrowed from S. J. Scott, Courtney Carver, and Julien Smith, but used in a different context here. The French philosopher Denis Diderot is mentioned in relation to his scarlet robe, which is linked to the "Diderot Effect," a term coined by Juliet Schor to describe the desire for consistency in our possessions. The text also credits BJ Fogg for the idea of linking a new habit to an old one, a concept used in the context of habit stacking.
