CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the influence of group pressure on decision-making accuracy, citing an experiment where two-thirds of decisions were correct. It also references a study on chimpanzee behavior, suggesting learning effective methods can be costly. The text further explores the concept of societal motives, comparing society to a human body with the state as the brain. It mentions a Twitter post questioning what a state's 'food' might be, hinting at underlying motivations. The text also discusses the role of emotions and feelings in decision-making, referencing a study on the impact of damage to the human prefrontal cortex.
