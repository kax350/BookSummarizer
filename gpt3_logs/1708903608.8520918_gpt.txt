Shaming obese people with weight-loss


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention was established to address drug abuse, particularly heroin addiction, which was prevalent among soldiers in Vietnam. Research indicates that 90% of heroin users relapse after inpatient treatment. Studies also suggest that disciplined individuals are more successful at structuring their lives and practicing self-restraint, often avoiding situations that require it. This is linked to the psychology of habit, where encoded habits are ready for use when cued. However, the internalization of these cues can lead to negative outcomes, such as the shaming of obese individuals in weight-loss programs.
