frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you dont know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival. Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brains reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose. A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way, if only with additional flavoring. Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your moutha quality known as orosensation. French fries, for example, are a potent combinationgolden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.     Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy. Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same sensations over and overhows that seventeenth bite of kale taste? After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting,


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The human brain has evolved to highly value salt, sugar, and fat due to our ancestors' need for calorie-dense foods for survival. However, in today's calorie-rich environment, these cravings are no longer beneficial to our health. Despite this, our brains continue to crave these foods due to unchanged reward centers. The modern food industry capitalizes on these cravings, investing heavily in food science to create products that are more appealing to consumers. This includes enhancing foods with additional flavoring, optimizing texture or 'orosensation', and increasing 'dynamic contrast' - a combination of sensations like crunchy and creamy. These techniques keep the eating experience novel and interesting, unlike natural, unprocessed foods which can become monotonous, leading to a feeling of fullness.
