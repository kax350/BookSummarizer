Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you dont follow through.

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the concept of a "habit contract" as a tool for personal accountability in achieving goals. This contract is a verbal or written agreement outlining a commitment to a specific habit and the consequences for not adhering to it. The example given is of Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur who created a habit contract to lose weight. His contract detailed his diet and exercise plan, daily habits, and the punishment for non-compliance, which included dressing formally for work and paying his trainer $200. This strategy is likened to societal rules and legislation, where group agreement and enforcement shape behavior.
