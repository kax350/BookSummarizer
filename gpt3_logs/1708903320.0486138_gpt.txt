Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you dont want to lose your progress by breaking the streak.  Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying. This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your results growthe size of your     investment portfolio, the length of your book manuscriptand if it feels good, then youre more likely to endure. Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: youre focused on the process rather than the result. Youre not fixated on getting sixpack abs, youre just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesnt miss workouts. In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and dont want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.* You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited so long to talk about it? Despite all the benefits, Ive left this discussion until now for a simple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habit youre trying to build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle when youre already struggling to follow a diet. Writing down every sales call seems tedious when youve got work to do. It feels easier to say, Ill just eat less. Or, Ill try harder. Or, Ill remember to do it. People inevitably tell me things like, I have a decision journal, but I wish I used it


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Habit tracking is a beneficial tool that serves as a visual cue, motivates progress, and provides satisfaction upon completion of tasks. It keeps focus on the process rather than the result, aiding in the formation of desired habits. However, despite its advantages, habit tracking is often resisted due to the perceived burden of maintaining two habits: the desired habit and the habit of tracking it. This resistance can make tasks like counting calories or logging sales calls seem tedious, leading people to opt for less structured approaches.
