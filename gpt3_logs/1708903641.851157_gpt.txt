CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the adaptability of the brain, referencing various studies and theories. Terje Lmo discovered long-term potentiation in 1966, which is the brain's ability to strengthen signal transmissions over time. Donald O. Hebb's theory, "Neurons that fire together wire together," supports this. Studies have shown that specific brain areas can develop based on activities; musicians have a larger cerebellum, and mathematicians have increased gray matter in the parietal cortex. Research on London taxi drivers revealed that learning the city's layout led to structural brain changes.
