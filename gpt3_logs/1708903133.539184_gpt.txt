than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.* It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, The best is the enemy of the good.     I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but theyre not the same. When youre in motion, youre planning and strategizing and learning.

However, only action can lead to the desired results, such as physical fitness or successful projects.
