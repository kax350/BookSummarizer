line is paraphrased from Greg McKeown, who wrote, Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress. Greg McKeown, Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less (Currency, 2014). The first mistake is never the one that ruins you: In fact, research has shown that missing a habit once has virtually no impact on the odds of developing a habit over the long-term, regardless of when the mistake occurs. As long as you get back on track, youre fine.

Missing once is an accident: Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. I swear I read this line somewhere or perhaps paraphrased it from something similar, but despite my best efforts all of my searches for a source are coming up empty. Maybe I came up with it, but my best guess is it belongs to an unidentified genius instead. When a measure becomes a target: This definition of Goodharts Law was actually formulated by the British anthropologist Marilyn Strathern.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the importance of progress as a form of human motivation, as suggested by Greg McKeown. It emphasizes that missing a habit once doesn't impact long-term habit formation, but missing it twice can lead to a new habit. The text also mentions Goodhart's Law, formulated by Marilyn Strathern, which suggests that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. The text also references Roger Fisher's work on preventing nuclear war and the introduction of the first seat belt law.
