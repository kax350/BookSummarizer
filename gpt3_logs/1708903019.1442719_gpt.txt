Tinbergenwho eventually won a Nobel Prize for his workwas investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often seen flying along the seashores of North America. Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot whenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Habits are hard to forget, and self-control is a short-term strategy best used to avoid tempting situations. To create a good habit, one should make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. This can be achieved by being aware of current habits, setting clear intentions, using habit stacking, and designing an environment conducive to good habits. Conversely, to break a bad habit, one should make it invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying, primarily by reducing exposure to the cues that trigger it. The text also mentions a study by Niko Tinbergen on herring gulls, which contributed to our understanding of motivation.
