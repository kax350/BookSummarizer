it. The problem wasnt knowledge. The problem was consistency. That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to supply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience. In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap, Luby told me. The study participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it. The soap foamed easily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great. Instantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable. I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit adoption, Luby said. It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing ones teeth. The marketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience. Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent. The long-term effects were even better. We went back to some of the households in Karachi six years after, Luby told me. Over 95 percent of households who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when our study team visited. . . . We had not given any soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the trial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had     maintained the practice. It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasureeven minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

A team led by Luby partnered with Procter & Gamble to promote handwashing in a neighborhood in Pakistan by supplying Safeguard soap, a premium product that provided a pleasurable sensory experience. The goal was not just to change behavior, but to encourage habit adoption. The strategy led to significant health improvements, with rates of diarrhea, pneumonia, and impetigo falling by 52%, 48%, and 35% respectively. Even six years later, over 95% of households maintained a handwashing station, demonstrating the effectiveness of the fourth Law of Behavior Change: making a behavior satisfying encourages its repetition.
