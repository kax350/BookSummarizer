Write a concise summary of the following:


pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink when thirsty.     The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the brains resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones. Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You dont have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.  HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch researchers began to pay close attention to the countrys energy usage. In one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less energy than their neighborsdespite the homes being of similar size and getting electricity for the same price. It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical except for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had one in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior. Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy not to do


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The human body has around eleven million sensory receptors, with nearly ten million dedicated to vision, making it our most powerful sense and a significant influencer of our behavior. Small changes in our visual environment can lead to significant shifts in our actions. Therefore, it's crucial to create environments filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones. An example of this is a study from the 1970s energy crisis, where Dutch researchers found that homeowners used less energy when their electrical meters were in visible locations. This suggests that we are more likely to change our habits when cues are noticeable and easy to track. Thus, we can design our environments for success by making beneficial cues more visible.
