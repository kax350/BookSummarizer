nice and lathers wellare signals that tell the brain: This feels good. Do this again, next time. Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating. Take the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasnt until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland resinschewy, but not tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step further and began pushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean mouth. Advertisements told readers to Refresh Your Taste. Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world. Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products. These flavors dont improve the effectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a clean mouth feel and make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didnt like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, which proved to be more satisfying. Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting. Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the concept of behavior change, emphasizing that behaviors that provide pleasure or satisfaction are likely to be repeated, while those that are unsatisfying or unpleasant are avoided. This principle is illustrated through the examples of Wrigley's chewing gum and flavored toothpaste, both of which became popular due to the pleasurable experiences they provided, such as tasty flavors and a fresh mouth feel. The text also highlights a personal anecdote about a woman who deliberately acted dull to discourage a narcissistic relative from spending time with her, further demonstrating the principle that behaviors yielding negative outcomes are avoided.
