to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face. If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works. We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share the dopamine spike.  THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldnt eat. They wouldnt have sex. They didnt crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst. In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopaminereleasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didnt want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped. When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within

RESPONSE:

The text discusses the role of dopamine in forming and maintaining habits. It explains that dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is crucial in creating cravings and desires. This was discovered in a 1954 experiment by neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner, who found that blocking dopamine in rats led to a loss of will to live, as they no longer craved anything, even basic necessities. However, the rats still experienced pleasure when given sugar, indicating that dopamine is not linked to pleasure but to desire and action. The text suggests that understanding this dopamine-driven feedback loop can help make habits more enticing and irresistible.
