many things working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.  HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water can flow through, but not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which water passes through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank up the valve and force more water out. The second option is to simply remove the bend in the hose and let water flow through naturally. Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it. One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesnt add much friction to your lifestyle. By     comparison, if the gym is off the path of your normal commuteeven by just a few blocksnow youre going out of your way to get there. Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The text emphasizes the importance of reducing friction in life to make it easier to adopt beneficial habits and overcome challenges. It uses the analogy of a bent garden hose to illustrate the concept, suggesting that making habits simple and easy is akin to removing the bend in the hose, allowing water (or progress) to flow naturally. The text also highlights the role of environment design in habit formation, suggesting that new habits are easier to adopt when they fit into the existing flow of one's life. For instance, choosing a gym on the way to work reduces friction and makes the habit of exercising more likely to stick. The text also suggests that reducing friction within one's home or office can be effective in habit formation.
